Many implementations of the parallelizing a LU Factorization have been attempted recently. At the 13th IEEE International 
Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, a group from Greece presented a parallelization using a pipelining
technique in an OpenMP programming environment. They did this using coordinating threads with the help of an array of queues.
Another study done at NJIT parallelized by focusing on the load balancing techniques to translate hardware parallelization into
high speedups on real applications by ordering the matrices into BDB for and eliminating data dependencies and communication
during the factorization.
